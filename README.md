You have two sequences A and B consisting of integers, both of length N, and you would like them to be (strictly) increasing, 
i.e. for each K (0 ? K < N - 1), A[K] < A[K + 1] and B[K] < B[K + 1]. Thus, you need to modify the sequences, but the only 
manipulation you can perform is to swap an arbitrary element in sequence A with the corresponding element in sequence B. 
That is, both elements to be exchanged must occupy the same index position within each sequence.
